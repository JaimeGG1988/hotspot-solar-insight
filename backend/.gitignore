# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform.
#   In such cases, it may be better to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially true if you want to ensure deterministic builds.
#   However, in some cases, it may be advisable to ignore it. For example, if you are developing
#   a library that needs to support a wide range of dependency versions.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
# pdm.lock
# .pdm.toml

# PEP 582; __pypackages__ directory specified by PEP 582 is defined as a local package directory.
# It is not recommended to share this directory with other projects.
